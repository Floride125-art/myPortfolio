                    <p>About Me</p>
                    <p>A Full Stack Developer</p>
                    <p>I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated, responsible, and hardworking lady who pursued Information System at Akilah Campus and attended Moringa School for coding skills. I am experienced in Information System, Website design, and mobile application development. </p>
                    <p>I have decided to join a class on programming because I believed that programming is the concept that enables everyone to think outside of box. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Thus, I developed software engineering skills, Front-end Programming skills, and system analysis skills. I am interested in visual art and swimming.</p>

                <p>I have invested most my time in working on the project of facilitating people tor be able to get houses for renting. I have used html and css and very soon I  am adding javascript and database to all the interaction and be able to collect some info from users. The skills I gained from programming class, are the ones that kept me working so hard and get to improve as well. </p>

                    <p class="details">E-HRent is the website that I have developed will help tenants to be able to search for the houses for renting easily with out wasting most of their time and money for transport or giving to the agents who can assit them in houses searching. It is not only recommended for tenants but also landlord who need to make their properties be available for others to rent them.</p>
