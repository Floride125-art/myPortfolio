# FT E-portfolio
#### By Floride Tuyisenge
###### This my online portfolio that I designed for few days ago and I have tried my best to put detailed information about me so that whoever read it, will get to know who I am. It is one page website with different menu such as Home that briefly has my name and an image that describe what I like to do. There is also about me menu that have all information about me like skills, experience, interest, and hobbies. There is also contact me page that has all contacts information about me so that we can keep  in touch. Thus, I would like to keep in touch with many of you and become the best of best programmers in the world.
